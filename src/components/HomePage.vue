        A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography
        to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially,
        cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled.
